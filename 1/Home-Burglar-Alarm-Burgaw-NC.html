<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers recognize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
