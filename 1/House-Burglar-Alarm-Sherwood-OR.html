Audio enhances video surveillance to better spot and translate incidents in real-time. As an included advantage, an audio service can be quickly integrated into the existing security system. The audio feed can be sent using the same wireless or wired network that transmits the videos - hence improving system-wide deployment and distribution choices.</p>

<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced wise home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
