The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would require to be a best storm of scenarios for someone to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to replicate the issue. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, our company believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
