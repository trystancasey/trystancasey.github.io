<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the very concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation slowly developed into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to record video and enjoy it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
