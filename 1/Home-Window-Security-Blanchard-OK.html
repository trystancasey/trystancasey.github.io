As soon as any alarm integrated into the PCU was activated, the nearest camera to that location would be shown on that specific monitor. The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the direction of the event depends upon the preliminary requirements for area of coverage.

In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have discovered that they have not reduced criminal activity. "Once the crime and offense figures were gotten used to take account of the general down trend in offences and crimes," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular classifications however there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had minimized crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
