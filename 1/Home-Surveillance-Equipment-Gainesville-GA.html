<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
