<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales consultant. He supplied the recommendations concerning what was required for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek arrived and managed the installation right on time.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
