The Ring Floodlight Webcam combines two necessary gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight.

We truly enjoyed utilizing Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier package features an HD video doorbell for good measure.</p>

The cameras invested weeks securing our front door, notifying us to pals, family members, shipment individuals, and even the milkman. When we got a good enough take a look at those friendly faces, we slanted the whole collection outside for another two weeks to see what kind of results we would get when the cameras faced the house across the street, which is around 50 feet away.</p>
