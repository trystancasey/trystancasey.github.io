<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
