<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be convenient for installation. It also makes your camera more tamper-proof due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut. Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look similar to these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the exact same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually great.
