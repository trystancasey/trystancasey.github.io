<p>Nurse calling systems usually include emergency buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. He can press the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station if a client is having trouble. This is a basic switch that is typically open or typically closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and informs, sensors, access control, and so on. My mind conceptualized a method of not only supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system however integrating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
<p>Exterior - Even if your business does not keep anything of important outside, exterior security cameras can often be just as valuable as cameras put inside.
