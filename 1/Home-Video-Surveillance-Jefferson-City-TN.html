<h2>Wireless Camera Installation In Jefferson City</h2>
<p>The implicit validation for the current push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. But suicide assaulters are plainly not hindered by camera - and might even be attracted to the television coverage cameras can ensure - and the cost of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the restricted advantages that the system may provide in investigating attacks or attempted attacks after the truth (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
