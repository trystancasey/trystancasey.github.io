When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's generally far too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
