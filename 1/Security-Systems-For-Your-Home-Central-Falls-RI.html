Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to save and how long you prepare to keep recorded video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly.
