<p>Ring is one of the biggest names in the plugged-in home security video game, and the Ring Indoor Cam is created to pair with the company's Ring - Always Home app, along with,'s Turner explains, video doorbells. You can even pair multiple cameras together on the app, if you so dream. Bear in mind that Nest cameras aren't expertly monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)
