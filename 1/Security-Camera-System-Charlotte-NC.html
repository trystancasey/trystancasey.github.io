The infrared energy discharged by an item is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting small distinctions in temperature. The gadget gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level distinctions.
