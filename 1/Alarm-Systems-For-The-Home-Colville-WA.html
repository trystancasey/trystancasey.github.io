<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Offered. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small charge. Because it comes with multiple door and window sensors for full coverage, we suggest the eight-piece kit. We also suggest adding a doorbell camera eventually.

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.
