<p>Among IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send information over a wireless network. These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the footage from anywhere. A typical misunderstanding is that wireless means the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then connects to a router and the web. Finally, wire-free cameras are completely cable television complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the easiest choice to install and all of the recorded footage is saved in the cloud.</p>
