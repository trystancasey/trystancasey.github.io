<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to buying.</p>
