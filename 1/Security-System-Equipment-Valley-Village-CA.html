<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly chosen words) makes pre-shared essential WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any client in the network that knows the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>Even though 1080p is normally the standard resolution for cameras we've evaluated, there are advantages to models with higher-resolution sensors. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but almost all have digital zoom, which crop and increase the size of whatever the camera is recording. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things plainly.</p>
