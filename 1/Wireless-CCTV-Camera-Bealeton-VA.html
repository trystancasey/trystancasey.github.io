<h2>Motion Sensor Alarm Bealeton</h2>
<p>A little more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensors had actually been triggered.

Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
