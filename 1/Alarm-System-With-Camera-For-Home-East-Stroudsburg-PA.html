Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video you plan to store and how long you plan to keep recorded video footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly.
