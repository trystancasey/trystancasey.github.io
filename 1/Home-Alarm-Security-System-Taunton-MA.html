If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute considerably to police ability to nab burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops action to alarmed properties) a pricey and ineffective  approach to robbery decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
