Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
