<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the precise very same method. They use open and closed circuits to move an electrical existing. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
