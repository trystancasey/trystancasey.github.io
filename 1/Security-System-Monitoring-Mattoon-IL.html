Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for outdoor and indoor surveillance. Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These people are $18 a month less expensive and been in business 3 years so I'm comfy providing a shot.
