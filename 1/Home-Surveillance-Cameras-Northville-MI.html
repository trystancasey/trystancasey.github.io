<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

But if your main goal is keeping bad guys out of your house and securing your property, you don't require to invest a bundle.</p>
