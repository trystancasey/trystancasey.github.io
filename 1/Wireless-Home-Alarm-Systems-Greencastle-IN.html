Burglar alarms are intended to prevent break-in and to assist police nab burglars, which, if done dependably and efficiently, advantages the general public at large. If, however, alarm systems are undependable or inefficient, the drain on cops resources from reacting to them may outweigh their advantages.

Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's response time has definitely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all.

Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private guard. A number of cities likewise need an authorization to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many false alarms.</p>
