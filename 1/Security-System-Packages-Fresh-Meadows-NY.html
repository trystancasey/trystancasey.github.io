<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the really concept of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long method, covering several years. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet affordable systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and watch it later. Although video surveillance was monitored out of necessity in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the big quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, typically via 110VAC power.</p>

Rather, you turn informs on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like trigger a camera to record or activate the siren.
