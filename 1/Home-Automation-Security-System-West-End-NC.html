<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally prevent making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive.
