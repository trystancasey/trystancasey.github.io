<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially innovative, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year contract, however given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So pick what will be the better offer for you. If you know you'll stay put for a minimum of three years, opt for the agreement and enjoy those cost savings.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>

Still, we believe that the Arlo Pro 3 is a standout product with its 100% wire-free operation. Its remarkable video quality makes it tough for the competition to maintain. While it's more pricey than a lot of other cameras, the overall quality of the Arlo Pro 3 helps comprise the difference in price.</p>
