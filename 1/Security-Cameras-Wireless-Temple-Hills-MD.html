ADT Blue is a camera-heavy, Do It Yourself version of the ADT system, and we like its cameras far better than the conventional" ADT variations. The camera can record video in as much as 1080p, which looks perfectly great on a smartphone screen and won't tax your web connection too much. Netatmo likewise allows you to tweak the settings for each specific user - for instance, don't tape-record Abbie, but do record Ben. It's really pretty smart.</p>
