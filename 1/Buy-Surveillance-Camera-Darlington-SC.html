<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
