Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you intend to store and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage area quickly.
