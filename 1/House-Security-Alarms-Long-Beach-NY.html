<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped case that the camera beings in. Whilst these are fairly discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this does not stop them from hindering criminals.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions.
