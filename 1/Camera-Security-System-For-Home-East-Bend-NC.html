The $299 Nest Cam IQ Indoor camera has a lot of the exact same smarts and features as the Nest Hi speaker. It features HD live streaming, motion signals, person notifies and access to the Nest Aware service alternative.

<p>There have long been well-established guidelines governing the audio recording of people without their authorization (there is a reason surveillance cameras never have microphones).

And if you want to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera each month, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year. However if you want the outright best when it concerns video quality, the Arlo Ultra has it.</p>
