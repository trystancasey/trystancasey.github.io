<h3>Alarm System Security in Gonzales LA</h3>

Wide-angle lenses minimize the number of cameras required to monitor your home. Some outdoor security cameras have a wide-angle lens that might show a 360-degree view, however the best security cameras have a view of a minimum of 100 degrees or much better. After checking out the talk about this page I went to Armorax's website to see what they used; they have actually partnered with another security company and their starter package I think starts at $0 down. The panel and sensors are Qolsys, so that's good. Monitoring is priced well too, so all in all a great deal.</p>

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

As you can't deactivate it, it can't do things that a typical self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or activate the siren. Read our review here.</p>
