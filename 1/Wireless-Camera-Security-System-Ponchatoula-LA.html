<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
