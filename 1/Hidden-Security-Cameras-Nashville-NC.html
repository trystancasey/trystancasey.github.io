<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you intend to save and how long you plan to keep documented video footage. The footage is going to eat up storage area quickly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest footage as soon as you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not cautious, the system might overwrite archived footage that you still need.</p>
<p>For most commercial CCTV systems, structured cabling run throughout the walls, linking your security cameras to the server or NVR, will be an essential part. While increasingly more wireless security cameras are becoming popular, especially for home use, wired security cameras still rule supreme for more long-term and requiring security use. Some individuals would rather pay an alarm company the regular monthly monitoring rate rather of purchasing a self-monitored security system.

Nevertheless, remember that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all.
