<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible offenders are less likely to commit criminal offense if they think they are being enjoyed or have a greater risk of being collared. This is likewise called the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational crime avoidance method, which argues that chances to anger can be minimized by altering a range of systems such as increasing the danger of a wrongdoer being collared, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing benefits from crime commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
