Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
