<p>In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover an entire space when positioned inside your home. If put on an outside wall, it will cover a 5-tile radius. When a provider enables consumers to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring." Consumers can monitor their homes with the assistance of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras. In this case, the provider usually has a mobile app that customers can utilize to get informs on their phones. For the most part, consumers can also check the app to view live footage from security cameras.</p>
