<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. During testing, we found it was basic to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly activating when movement was detected. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get costly. It's also worth noting that it needs to be installed on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It also had the quietest alarm of all that we evaluated and there's no external monitoring service readily available.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
