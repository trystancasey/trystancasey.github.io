<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
