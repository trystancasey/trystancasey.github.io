<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
