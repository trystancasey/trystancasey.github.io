If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less burglaries across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police capability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to theft reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
