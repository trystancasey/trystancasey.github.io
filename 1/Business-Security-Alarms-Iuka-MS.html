Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
