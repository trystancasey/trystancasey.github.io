Amazon's face acknowledgment tool, Rekognition, is among the real-time video face recognition items presently being piloted by police departments around the country, in addition to the FBI.

You'll lose out on cameras, but besides that, you're getting everything with Smart Home that you receive from Vivint's top-tier bundle.</p>
