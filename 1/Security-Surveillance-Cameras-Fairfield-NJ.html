<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All things discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an object is referred to as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting tiny differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level differences.
