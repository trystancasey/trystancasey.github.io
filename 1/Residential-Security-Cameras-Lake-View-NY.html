<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for among our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.
