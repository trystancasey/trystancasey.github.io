In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs confirmation from a personal guard. Numerous cities likewise require a license to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are created to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on false alarms. Lots of towns will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
