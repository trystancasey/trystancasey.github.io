If you have a large home, you will need a system that has a long reception range and can handle a more substantial amount of info and signals.

It likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof since it does not have wires that can be cut. Regrettably I purchased 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Boy was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is actually terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
