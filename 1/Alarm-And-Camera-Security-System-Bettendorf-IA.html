Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
