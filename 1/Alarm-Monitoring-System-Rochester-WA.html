<h3>Recommended Home Security Systems in Washington</h3>
<p>Because it's more complex than it ought to be, we do not advise the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and an incredible value.

The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.

<p>If you have a bigger home or home you wish to keep an eye on, SimpliSafe might be too minimal for you. The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is excellent for keeping an eye on visitors and plan shipments, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable.

Lots of current outdoor Wi-Fi cameras use assistance for IFTTT (If This Then That), a web service that uses tiny programs (applets) that you develop to have the camera interact with other IFTTT-enabled gadgets. For example, you can have a smart plug turn on a light inside or activate an external siren when the camera discovers motion.</p>
