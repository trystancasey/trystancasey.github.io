Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a shrill, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi information. (You must play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, pet dogs shout, felines squeal, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
