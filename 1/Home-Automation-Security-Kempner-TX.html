<p>GO2 supplies full-service Video Surveillance Installation of hd (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Obviously, the obvious downside to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be costly. If the system was not set up throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to difficult areas that are sealed in basements or attics. Wired security systems are likewise vulnerable to power interruptions. Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of a failure, however long term failures will result in the system losing power.
