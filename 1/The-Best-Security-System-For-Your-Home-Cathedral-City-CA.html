We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Webcam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can record approximately 3 minutes without spaces in between clips, but entries were typically missing, regardless of showing up in the app's activity timeline. With standard wise home devices like automatic door locks, you can remain in bed and inspect that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you look out for potential bundle thieves or talk to visitors who stop by.</p>
