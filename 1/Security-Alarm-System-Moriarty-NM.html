<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by method of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you need extra cables. DVR systems are challenging to scale up due to the fact that as soon as every BNC connection is inhabited by a camera, you need to acquire a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also require that the connected cameras be in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
