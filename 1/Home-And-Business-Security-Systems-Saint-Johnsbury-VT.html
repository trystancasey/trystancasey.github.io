<p>Everybody we dealt with at NSS were very valuable and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we wanted, and they carried out with professionalism and proficiency.

Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you select the totally free self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>This system uses an electro-magnetic field disturbance principle based upon two unshielded (or 'leaking') coax cables buried approximately 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter produces constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the modification in field strength compromises due to the existence of an object and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is generated. The system is hidden after installation. Care must be taken to ensure the surrounding soil uses good drain in order to prevent annoyance alarms.</p>
