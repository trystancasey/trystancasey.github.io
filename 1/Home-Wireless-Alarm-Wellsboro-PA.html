<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can compare basic motion and individuals, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even recognize people you've labeled (after a knowing period). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone notifies-- and, in many cases, fewer false notifies. If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area, you will not need to stress over it recording or sending an alert whenever the dog walks by. (We think this is a more valuable function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's excellent that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Webcam.</p>
