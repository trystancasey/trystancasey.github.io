<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
