Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs each time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
