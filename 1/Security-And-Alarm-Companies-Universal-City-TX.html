Obviously, the apparent disadvantage to a wired security system is that the initial install can be costly. If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up might require drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and gaining access to tough spots that are sealed off in attics or basements. Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power blackouts. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of an interruption, but long term interruptions will lead to the system losing power.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would signal users when it spotted any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be a best storm of circumstances for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to duplicate the concern.
