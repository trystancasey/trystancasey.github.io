<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider location and therefore uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far larger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
