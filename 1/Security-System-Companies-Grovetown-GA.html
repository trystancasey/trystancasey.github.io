The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance providers bring into question the appropriateness of the present trend in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 complimentary incorrect alarms per calendar year, because they provide no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
