<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
