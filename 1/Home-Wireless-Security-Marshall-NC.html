However, there are a few things you need to understand prior to you run out and buy one.</p>
<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units detaching eight times over two months. Scout is really simple to use, especially if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based browsers, and it allows you to manage almost every aspect of the security system remotely, and it's extremely customizable.
