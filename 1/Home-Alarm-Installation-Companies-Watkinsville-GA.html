<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
