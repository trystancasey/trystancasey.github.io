<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
