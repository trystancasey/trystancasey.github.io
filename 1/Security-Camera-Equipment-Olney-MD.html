We recommend a top-tier plan if you're looking for overall home security with video surveillance and some cool home automation features (think smart lighting, clever thermostats, garage door openers, wise locks, etc.).</p>
<p>Video and image feeds have actually proved vital for surveillance - but there's space for more functionality by utilizing audio. Humans have 5 senses that collectively enable us to accurately vary our environment. Therefore, it only makes good sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more effective. And due to the fact that it's not useful to engage taste, touch, and odor remotely, the most effective video surveillance systems combine sight and hearing to enhance security coverage.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
