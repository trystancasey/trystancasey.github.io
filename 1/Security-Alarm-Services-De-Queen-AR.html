<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
