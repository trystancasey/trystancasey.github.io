<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
