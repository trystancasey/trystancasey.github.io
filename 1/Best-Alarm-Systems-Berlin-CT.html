CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention method, which argues that chances to anger can be decreased by modifying a range of systems such as increasing the threat of a transgressor being apprehended, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
