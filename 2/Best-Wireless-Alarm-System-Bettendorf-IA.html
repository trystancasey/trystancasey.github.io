Still, what you get for the cash is all the normal Arlo qualities in regards to the solid construct quality, outstanding camera video, tons of smart functions and a sleek app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor.

Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
