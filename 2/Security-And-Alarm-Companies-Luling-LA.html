<p>Complete a protection and the kind 1 or ADT Expert will call you, from time to time, about Protection 1, ADT and Lifeshield offers. You could spend a comparable amount for the very best home security system, but they do not monitor your cameras as proactively as Deep Guard. But, they're the best home security cameras if you're searching for active monitoring. One vital exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 per month, which might be an inexpensive option for customers in backwoods.
