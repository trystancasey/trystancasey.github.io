The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
