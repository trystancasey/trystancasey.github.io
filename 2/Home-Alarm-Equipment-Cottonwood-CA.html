Residence has upgraded that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which provides a much better variety for sensors. Both the original Residence system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we tested that also deals with HomeKit.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
