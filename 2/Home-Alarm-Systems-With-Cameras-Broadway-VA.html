<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity avoidance created to avoid both individual and home criminal activity and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
