<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as clients recognize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
