<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically advanced outdoor camera we have actually evaluated.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even recognize individuals you have actually identified (after a learning period).

Frontpoint's detectors are unsusceptible to animals weighing as much as 40 pounds. With ADT, the professional installer can customize the sensitivity level based upon your family pet's size.</p>
