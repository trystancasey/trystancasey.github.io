<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
