<h3>Security System Reviews Chatham VA 24531</h3>
<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer easy DIY installation, other companies use (and sometimes require) expert installation. Expert installation is available for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Bear in mind that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a pretty basic feature in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>Exterior - Even if your business doesn't keep anything of valuable outside, exterior security cameras can typically be simply as valuable as cameras positioned within. Exterior security cameras can monitor the parking lot, capture license plate numbers, or get a shot of a burglar's face if the indoor camera misses it. Outside cameras can likewise provide employees leaving late at night with assurance. On the other hand, if you don't wish to bother with this process yourself, you can utilize the Brinks Pro Install services. The installation charge for this additional service is $199 if you pay in advance or $10 monthly.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
