<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a variety of companies provide "totally free monitoring services" for the first couple of months.

<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
