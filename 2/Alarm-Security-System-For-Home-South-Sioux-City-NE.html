Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their design permits minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection instead of motion detection. This will provide more accurate and less frequent informs because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
