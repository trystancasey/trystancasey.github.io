<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound however subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or mindful they may be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people may find out to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers.
