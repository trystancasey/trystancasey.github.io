Wi-Fi coverage also impacts where you position a camera: If you want to put a camera in a spot that does not get a good Wi-Fi signal, consider updating your router or adding an extender or repeater. (For a look at our networking choices, see our guides to The very best Wi-Fi Router (for Many People)" and The Very Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good guideline that if your mobile phone or laptop computer gets decent Wi-Fi reception in the area you want to install the camera, you likely won't have an issue.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a learning duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
