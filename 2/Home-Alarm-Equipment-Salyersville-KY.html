<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a learning duration).
