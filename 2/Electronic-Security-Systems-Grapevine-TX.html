<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal offense prevention created to prevent both individual and property criminal activity and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security workers or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will lower criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
