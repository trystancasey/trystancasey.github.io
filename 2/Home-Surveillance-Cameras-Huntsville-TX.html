<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based on our testing, must supply at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on usage). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more offered for a month-to-month cost ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to properly discover motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That likewise saves battery life, however it might leave you with tape-recording spaces during essential security events.
