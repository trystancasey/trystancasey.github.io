The Wyze Web cam can also catch video to the cloud, but the complimentary account is restricted to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to record again, which means you may be missing a lot. Wyze's just recently released Total Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row.

Recordings are easy to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, but we don't advise that for home security due to the fact that if it's stolen, you do not have a backup.</p>
