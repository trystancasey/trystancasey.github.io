You can get all the basics like push, sms, and e-mail notifies, in addition to 4G LTE cellular backup and battery for Scout's most affordable, Constantly On" plan. Nevertheless, you will need to spend for additional $2.99 cloud camera storage (per camera) per month, and this doesn't included expert monitoring. This additional cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- respective minimum prices monthly for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
