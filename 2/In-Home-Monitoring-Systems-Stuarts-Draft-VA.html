Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a larger location such as your front or back garden and can follow motion with ease.</p>

When the magnet is moved far from the reed switch, the reed switch either closes or opens, again based on whether or not the style is normally open or normally closed. This action paired with an electric current (normally at 12V DC) allows an alarm control panel to discover a fault on that zone or circuit. These type of sensors are extremely typical and are found either wired straight to an alarm control board, or they can normally be discovered in wireless door or window contacts as sub-components.</p>
