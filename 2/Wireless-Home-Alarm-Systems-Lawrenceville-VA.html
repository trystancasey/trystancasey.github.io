Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
