It also succeeds in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to keep video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.
