<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible wrongdoers are less likely to commit criminal offense if they think they are being watched or have a greater risk of being collared. This is likewise called the logical option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational crime prevention technique, which argues that opportunities to upset can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a transgressor being collared, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This indicates that the offender needs to know the added surveillance for it to achieve its wanted result.</p>
