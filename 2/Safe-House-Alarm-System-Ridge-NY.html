<p>Twenty-five years ago, basic and business communications were mainly simultaneous. To achieve nearly anything, someone live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when handling global and nationwide business.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
