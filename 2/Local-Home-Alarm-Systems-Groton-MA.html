<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced wise home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, usually referred to as shock sensing units, are different because they are set up on the glass pane.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>
