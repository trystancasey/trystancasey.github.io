<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system.

Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
