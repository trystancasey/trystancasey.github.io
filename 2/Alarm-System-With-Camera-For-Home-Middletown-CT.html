The Arlo Pro is the company's first wireless home security camera, and though it's been eclipsed in features and resolutions by newer models, the original still holds up well.

If the camera is pointed towards a high-traffic location, you will not need to stress over it recording or sending an alert each time the dog strolls by. (We think this is a more valuable feature if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's great that it's not essential, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Webcam.</p>
