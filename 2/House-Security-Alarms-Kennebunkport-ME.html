<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control panel (usually located in the entryway hall) that is used to arm and disarm the alarm and alert you if any sensing units have actually been triggered, wise alarms are controlled from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensors have been activated, rather than getting home to find your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and possibly frustrating your neighbours).
