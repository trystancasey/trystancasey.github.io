<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers fund authorities response to alarmed homes) a ineffective and expensive method to break-in reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
