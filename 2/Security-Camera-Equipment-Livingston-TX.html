<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see precisely when a particular individual gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time.

Be prepared to supply your new company with the documents of previous payment.</p>
