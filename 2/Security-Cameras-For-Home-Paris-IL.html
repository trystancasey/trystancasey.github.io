<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against theft, vandalism, and fraud. Tip: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should once again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building.

Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
