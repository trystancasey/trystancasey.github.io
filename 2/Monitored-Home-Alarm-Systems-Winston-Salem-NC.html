<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
