<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
