<p>If you are not exactly sure about whether the wireless CCTV camera type will operate in a certain area, a good concept is to check it with your smartphone.

It has to be plugged in to work-- no battery choice here, sorry-- but the camera comes with a 25-foot power cord, which must assist with installation.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
