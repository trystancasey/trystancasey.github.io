<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being viewed by the authorities - or mindful they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people may find out to be cautious about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or druggies." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain found that people deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
