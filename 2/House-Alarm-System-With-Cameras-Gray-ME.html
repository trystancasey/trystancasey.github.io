<h3>The Best Security System For Your Home Gray ME 04039</h3>
<p>TP-Link's Kasa Webcam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of vision that could equal a few of our top picks.

<p>Three big advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, mobility and expandability. Renters, unlike house owners, generally avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control board, sensors and other parts can easily be established at various properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.

With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
