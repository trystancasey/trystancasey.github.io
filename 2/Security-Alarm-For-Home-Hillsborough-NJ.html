<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" refers to the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much picture details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
