<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.

However if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
