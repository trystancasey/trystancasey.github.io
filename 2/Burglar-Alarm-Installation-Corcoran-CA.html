<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Fantastic clearness. I wished to set up seeing on my cellular phone however had a couple questions that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely buy from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. However, those functions come at a comparatively high rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 per year) for thirty days of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the preliminary charge. By contrast, Arlo charges $3 monthly for person detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage up to 31 days.</p>
<p>In regards to its function list, it's an excellent plan - there's a heat sensing unit along with a camera, which lowers the number of incorrect positives you're going to get, plus two-way audio and night vision. The video goes up to 1080p in terms of resolution and the two lamps max out at 2,500 lumens of brightness, which is rather intense. For all the benefits of Nest Secure, the quality of customer service is not one of them.
