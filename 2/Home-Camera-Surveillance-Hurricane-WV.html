<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, theft, and vandalism. Recommendation: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating pricey incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically switch off the heating systems.

<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to aim to make a camera with the most difficult setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you have to put and download the app in your email address.

<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
