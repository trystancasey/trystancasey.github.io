<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public areas. When people are being viewed by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has explained, "understanding that you are being watched by armed government agents tends to deter things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people might discover to be cautious about the books and periodicals they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, druggies or hookers." Certainly, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to prolonged surveillance.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption plans, any customer in the network that understands the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>
