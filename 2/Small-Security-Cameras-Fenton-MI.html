<h3>Surveillance Security Camera Fenton MI 48430</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is an easy-to-use outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, must offer a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that provides 7 days of free cloud storage (with more available for a month-to-month fee ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will enable the camera to correctly find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it may leave you with recording spaces throughout essential security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd recommend one of our top picks, however the Arlo is terrific for checking in on family and family pets-- or roaming cats slinking around your lawn.</p>
