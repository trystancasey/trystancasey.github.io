<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, spanning several decades. The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The technology slowly progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape video and view it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to enhance the outcome of security systems.</p>
<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity prevention designed to avoid both individual and property criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will reduce crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring locations where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then relayed over a local location network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to communicate by means of network or mobile app for seeing.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much wider location and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
