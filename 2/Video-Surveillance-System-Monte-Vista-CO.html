<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
