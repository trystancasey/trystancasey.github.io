Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The response depends upon a couple of elements: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you intend to save and the length of time you prepare to keep recorded footage. If there are lots of cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly.

Operators might also begin calling a list of contact number offered by the client to call someone to go check on the secured facilities. Some zones may set off a call to the local heating oil company to go look at the system, or a call to the owner with details of which room might be getting flooded.
