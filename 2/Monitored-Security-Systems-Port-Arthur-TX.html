<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, vandalism, and fraud. Idea: Often keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of removing costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a particular level, you can make it automatically turn off the heater. If the motion sensing units are set off, you can instantly make the smart lights turn on to scare away prospective burglars.</p>
<p>Everybody we dealt with at NSS were very practical and accommodating. The services they supplied were exactly what we desired, and they performed with professionalism and skills.
