ADT does not have the greatest customer service track record amongst the companies we considered, acquiring more than 3,000 problems on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this as much as the truth that ADT has numerous million more customers than its rivals, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>

SimpliSafe responded with a declaration stating the system would notify users when it discovered any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, claiming that there would need to be an ideal storm of circumstances for someone to effectively hack the system.
