<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All objects release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy produced by an object is known as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it emits. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of spotting small distinctions in temperature level. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and develops an electronic image based on details about the temperature level distinctions.
