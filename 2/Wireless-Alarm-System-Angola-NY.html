<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. Once the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to recognize an offense.

Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
