<h3>Best Home Security System in Maryland</h3>
<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger area and therefore uses less pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
