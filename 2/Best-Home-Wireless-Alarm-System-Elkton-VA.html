<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

They're also preferred for applications where it's beneficial to install cameras in plainly noticeable locations.

The instructions of the camera is set during installation. Lots of security cameras also accept interchangeable lenses and real estates, so you have the flexibility to fulfill a wide range of surveillance requirements.</p>
