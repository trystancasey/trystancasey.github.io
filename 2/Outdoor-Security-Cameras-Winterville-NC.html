When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
