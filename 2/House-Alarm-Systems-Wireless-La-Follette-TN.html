Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. But the Secure is costly, additional sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you do not commit to a three-year agreement.</p>

You'll miss out on cameras, but other than that, you're getting whatever with Smart Home that you obtain from Vivint's top-tier plan.</p>
