<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends possible culprits are less most likely to devote crime if they think they are being viewed or have a greater threat of being collared.

CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be reduced by changing a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the crime, reducing rewards from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
