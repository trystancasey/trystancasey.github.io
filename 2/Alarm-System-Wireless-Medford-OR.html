<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everybody going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
