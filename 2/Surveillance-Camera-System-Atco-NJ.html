<p>Canary has actually overcome some initial software issues to provide a really decent security camera choice: especially that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion signals (plus clear audio).

Ring advises this bundle for homes with up to 2 bedrooms and around 2,000 square feet.

The cost of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces.
