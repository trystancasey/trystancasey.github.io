Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
