I put this wireless CCTV camera type top of the list just because if you do not know it, you will lose big. Smart technology knows the distinction. With smart sensing units, you and your animal can remain protected without fear of incorrect alarms. It is much better to have a different computer system (server) for publishing video to the cloud.
