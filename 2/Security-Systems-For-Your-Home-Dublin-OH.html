<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, scams, and theft. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we should again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of eliminating expensive false alarms.
