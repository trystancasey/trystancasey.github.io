The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
