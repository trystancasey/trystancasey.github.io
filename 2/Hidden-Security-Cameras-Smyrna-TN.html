In this post, the term resolution" describes the variety of dots (pixels) that make up a video picture; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution consists of about 4 times as much image information as 1080p.
