<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station.

(We believe this is a better function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Cam.</p>
