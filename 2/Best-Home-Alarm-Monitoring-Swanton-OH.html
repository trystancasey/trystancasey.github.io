<p>Absolutely nothing is more important than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This unit is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home elements in your house.

<p>Most of the cameras we checked need an AC outlet, so placement is definitely a factor. A few models use batteries, making positioning more versatile, but this needs other trade-offs, which we highlight in the Competition area.

(For a take a look at our networking picks, see our guides to The Best Wi-Fi Router (for The Majority Of People)" and The Best Wi-Fi Extender and Signal Booster") It's a good rule of thumb that if your mobile phone or laptop computer gets good Wi-Fi reception in the location you want to install the camera, you likely will not have an issue.</p>

(We believe this is a better function if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, including the Nest Cam.</p>
