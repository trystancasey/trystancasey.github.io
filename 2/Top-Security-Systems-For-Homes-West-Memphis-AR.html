<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to sophisticated smart home enthusiasts or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

Which, you picture, would suffice to send even the most committed career criminal scuttling empty-handed down the roadway.</p>
